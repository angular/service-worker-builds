For\n   *     example, use `registerWithDelay:5000` to register the ServiceWorker after 5 seconds. If\n   *     `<timeout>` is omitted, is defaults to `0`, which will register the ServiceWorker as soon\n   *     as possible but still asynchronously, once all pending micro-tasks are completed.\n   * - An Observable factory function: A function that returns an `Observable`.\n   *     The function will be used at runtime to obtain and subscribe to the `Observable` and the\n   *     ServiceWorker will be registered as soon as the first value is emitted.\n   *\n   * Default: 'registerWhenStable:30000'\n   */\n  registrationStrategy?: string | (() => Observable<unknown>);\n}\n\n/**\n * @publicApi\n *\n * Sets up providers to register the given Angular Service Worker script.\n *\n * If `enabled` is set to `false` in the given options, the module will behave as if service\n * workers are not supported by the browser, and the service worker will not be registered.\n *\n * Example usage:\n * ```ts\n * bootstrapApplication(AppComponent, {\n *   providers: [\n *     provideServiceWorker('ngsw-worker.js')\n *   ],\n * });\n * ```\n */\nexport function provideServiceWorker(\n  script: string,\n  options: SwRegistrationOptions = {},\n): EnvironmentProviders {\n  return makeEnvironmentProviders([\n    SwPush,\n    SwUpdate,\n    {provide: SCRIPT, useValue: script},\n    {provide: SwRegistrationOptions, useValue: options},\n    {\n      provide: NgswCommChannel,\n      useFactory: ngswCommChannelFactory,\n      deps: [SwRegistrationOptions, PLATFORM_ID],\n    },\n    {\n      provide: APP_INITIALIZER,\n      useFactory: ngswAppInitializer,\n      deps: [Injector, SCRIPT, SwRegistrationOptions, PLATFORM_ID],\n      multi: true,\n    },\n  ]);\n}\n","/**\n * @license\n * Copyright Google LLC All Rights Reserved.\n *\n * Use of this source code is governed by an MIT-style license that can be\n * found in the LICENSE file at https://angular.io/license\n */\n\nimport {ModuleWithProviders, NgModule} from '@angular/core';\n\nimport {provideServiceWorker, SwRegistrationOptions} from './provider';\nimport {SwPush} from './push';\nimport {SwUpdate} from './update';\n\n/**\n * @publicApi\n */\n@NgModule({providers: [SwPush, SwUpdate]})\nexport class ServiceWorkerModule {\n  /**\n   * Register the given Angular Service Worker script.\n   *\n   * If `enabled` is set to `false` in the given options, the module will behave as if service\n   * workers are not supported by the browser, and the service worker will not be registered.\n   */\n  static register(\n    script: string,\n    options: SwRegistrationOptions = {},\n  ): ModuleWithProviders<ServiceWorkerModule> {\n    return {\n      ngModule: ServiceWorkerModule,\n      providers: [provideServiceWorker(script, options)],\n    };\n  }\n}\n","/**\n * @license\n * Copyright Google LLC All Rights Reserved.\n *\n * Use of this source code is governed by an MIT-style license that can be\n * found in the LICENSE file at https://angular.io/license\n */\n\n/**\n * @module\n * @description\n * Entry point for all public APIs of this package.\n */\nexport * from './src/index';\n\n// This file only reexports content of the `src` folder.

The available option are:\n   *\n   * - `registerWhenStable:<timeout>`: Register as soon as the application stabilizes (no pending\n   *     micro-/macro-tasks) but no later than `<timeout>` milliseconds. If the app hasn't\n   *     stabilized after `<timeout>` milliseconds (for example, due to a recurrent asynchronous\n   *     task), the ServiceWorker will be registered anyway.\n   *     If `<timeout>` is omitted, the ServiceWorker will only be registered once the app\n   *     stabilizes.\n   * - `registerImmediately`: Register immediately.\n   * - `registerWithDelay:<timeout>`: Register with a delay of `<timeout>` milliseconds. For\n   *     example, use `registerWithDelay:5000` to register the ServiceWorker after 5 seconds. If\n   *     `<timeout>` is omitted, is defaults to `0`, which will register the ServiceWorker as soon\n   *     as possible but still asynchronously, once all pending micro-tasks are completed.\n   *

/**
 * Subscribe and listen to
 * [Web Push
 * Notifications](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Push_API/Best_Practices) through
 * Angular Service Worker.
 *
 * @usageNotes
 *
 * You can inject a `SwPush` instance into any component or service
 * as a dependency.
 *
 * <code-example path="service-worker/push/module.ts" region="inject-sw-push"
 * header="app.component.ts"></code-example>
 *
 * To subscribe, call `SwPush.requestSubscription()`, which asks the user for permission.
 * The call returns a `Promise` with a new
 * [`PushSubscription`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/PushSubscription)
 * instance.
 *
 * <code-example path="service-worker/push/module.ts" region="subscribe-to-push"
 * header="app.component.ts"></code-example>
 *
 * A request is rejected if the user denies permission, or if the browser
 * blocks or does not support the Push API or ServiceWorkers.
 * Check `SwPush.isEnabled` to confirm status.
 *
 * Invoke Push Notifications by pushing a message with the following payload.
 *
 * ```ts
 * {
 *   "notification": {
 *     "actions": NotificationAction[],
 *     "badge": USVString
 *     "body": DOMString,
 *     "data": any,
 *     "dir": "auto"|"ltr"|"rtl",
 *     "icon": USVString,
 *     "image": USVString,
 *     "lang": DOMString,
 *     "renotify": boolean,
 *     "requireInteraction": boolean,
 *     "silent": boolean,
 *     "tag": DOMString,
 *     "timestamp": DOMTimeStamp,
 *     "title": DOMString,
 *     "vibrate": number[]
 *   }
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * Only `title` is required. See `Notification`
 * [instance
 * properties](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Notification#Instance_properties).
 *
 * While the subscription is active, Service Worker listens for
 * [PushEvent](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/PushEvent)
 * occurrences and creates
 * [Notification](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Notification)
 * instances in response.
 *
 * Unsubscribe using `SwPush.unsubscribe()`.
 *
 * An application can subscribe to `SwPush.notificationClicks` observable to be notified when a user
 * clicks on a notification. For example:
 *
 * <code-example path="service-worker/push/module.ts" region="subscribe-to-notification-clicks"
 * header="app.component.ts"></code-example>

     * possible but without affecting the application's first time load.
     *
     * Still, there might be cases where you want more control over when the ServiceWorker is
     * registered (for example, there might be a long-running timeout or polling interval, preventing
     * the app from stabilizing). The available option are:
     *
     * - `registerWhenStable:<timeout>`: Register as soon as the application stabilizes (no pending
     *     micro-/macro-tasks) but no later than `<timeout>` milliseconds. If the app hasn't
     *     stabilized after `<timeout>` milliseconds (for example, due to a recurrent asynchronous
     *     task), the ServiceWorker will be registered anyway.
     *     If `<timeout>` is omitted, the ServiceWorker will only be registered once the app
     *     stabilizes.
     * - `registerImmediately`: Register immediately.
     * - `registerWithDelay:<timeout>`: Register with a delay of `<timeout>` milliseconds. For
     *     example, use `registerWithDelay:5000` to register the ServiceWorker after 5 seconds. If
     *     `<timeout>` is omitted, is defaults to `0`, which will register the ServiceWorker as soon
     *     as possible but still asynchronously, once all pending micro-tasks are completed.
     * - An [Observable](guide/observables) factory function: A function that returns an `Observable`.
     *     The function will be used at runtime to obtain and subscribe to the `Observable` and the
     *     ServiceWorker will be registered as soon as the first value is emitted.
     *
     * Default: 'registerWhenStable:30000'
